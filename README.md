# Generate a table of contents for scientific reading

When we download a book, we find that there is no table of contents.

We can get the HTML language of the table of contents from the book's WEB site. 
like 
 ```
 <ul id='treeDemo' class='ztree'>...</ul>
```
copy and paste that to test.txt file.   run python genCatalog.py script.
Generate the book table of contents to catlog.txt file.
